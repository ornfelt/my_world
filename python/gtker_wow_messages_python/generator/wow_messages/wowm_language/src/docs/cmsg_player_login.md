# CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN

## Client Version 1, Client Version 2, Client Version 3

Command to log into the specified character.

This is sent after the client has been authenticated and served the character list with [SMSG_CHAR_ENUM](./smsg_char_enum.md).

If the player receives a [SMSG_CHARACTER_LOGIN_FAILED](./smsg_character_login_failed.md) it will return to the character screen and send a [CMSG_CHAR_ENUM](./cmsg_char_enum.md).
