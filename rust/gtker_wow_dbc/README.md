# `wow_dbc`

World of Warcraft 1.12 (vanilla), 2.4.3 (The Burning Crusade), and 3.3.5 (Wrath of the Lich King) [DBC (DatabaseClient)](https://wowdev.wiki/DBC) parser library.
Auto generated from the `.xml` files found in `rxml/xml/`, these are taken from [the Ember private server project](https://github.com/EmberEmu/Ember/tree/development/dbcs) with permission and autogenerated from `.dbd` files from [WoWDBDefs](https://github.com/wowdev/WoWDBDefs).

The project is split into the subdirectories:

* `rxml`: Auto generates the definitions from the `.xml` files in `rxml/xml`. Run `cargo gen` to generate libraries.
* `wow_dbc`: Rust library for the DBC reading and writing. [On crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/wow_dbc) and [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/wow_dbc/latest/wow_dbc/).
* `wow_dbc_converter`: Executable that converts DBC files to SQLite databases (Vanilla, TBC and Wrath supported).
