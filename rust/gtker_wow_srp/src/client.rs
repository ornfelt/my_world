//! Contains all functionality related to the client part.
//!
//! All arrays are **little endian**.
//! See `examples/client.rs` for how to authenticate with a server.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The [Typestate](https://yoric.github.io/post/rust-typestate/) pattern is used
//! in order to prevent incorrect use.
//! This means that whenever the next step of computation takes place, you call a function
//! taking `self`, consuming the old object, and returning the new object.
//!
//! The state machine goes like this:
//! ```text
//! SrpClientChallenge -> SrpClient -| -> SrpClientReconnection
//!                                            ^      |
//!                                            |------|
//! ```
//! Where an [`SrpClientReconnection`] object is a temporary data struct from
//! [`SrpClient::calculate_reconnect_values`]
//! that contains only the necessary reconnect values.
//!
//! When reaching [`SrpClient`] the client has fully authenticated with the server and should be able to
//! send the [`CMD_REALM_LIST_Client`](https://wowdev.wiki/CMD_REALM_LIST_Client) packet.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The process starts with an [`SrpClientChallenge`] and ends
//! with the [`SrpClient`] which returns [`SrpClientReconnection`]s for reconnecting challenges.
//!
//! The full example including network code can be found in `examples/client.rs`.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! The client has some limitations that enable a simpler overall design:
//!
//! * Fixed [32 byte](`LARGE_SAFE_PRIME_LENGTH`) large safe prime length.
//! Despite the field in the packet being variable the client is unable
//! to use values greater than 32 bytes.
//! * Only accepting valid [`NormalizedString`] values.
//! This is done to unify the server and client implementations.
//! * [GENERATOR](crate::GENERATOR) can be only be a u8 despite the
//! [`CMD_AUTH_LOGON_CHALLENGE_Server`](https://wowdev.wiki/CMD_AUTH_LOGON_CHALLENGE_Server)
//! packet having a variable sized generator field.
//! This is done because there are no generator values larger than 255.
//!
