### Enumerators
| Enumerator | Value  | Comment |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| `LOCK_PLAYER_CAST_ANIM` | 1 (0x01) | also do not send standstate update |
| `UNKNOWN2` | 2 (0x02) |  |
| `UNKNOWN4` | 4 (0x04) |  |
| `UNKNOWN8` | 8 (0x08) |  |
| `UNKNOWN16` | 16 (0x10) |  |
| `AMMO` | 32 (0x20) | 2 functions are called on 2 values |
| `DEST_LOCATION` | 64 (0x40) |  |
| `ITEM_CASTER` | 256 (0x100) |  |
| `UNK200` | 512 (0x200) |  |
| `EXTRA_MESSAGE` | 1024 (0x400) | TARGET MISSES AND OTHER MESSAGES LIKE 'Resist' |
| `POWER_UPDATE` | 2048 (0x800) | seems to work hand in hand with some visual effect of update actually |
| `UNK2000` | 8192 (0x2000) |  |
| `UNK1000` | 4096 (0x1000) | no idea |
| `UNK8000` | 32768 (0x8000) | seems to make server send extra 2 bytes before UNK1 and after UNK20000 |
| `ADJUST_MISSILE` | 131072 (0x20000) | seems to make server send an uint32 after `m_targets.write` |
| `UNK40000` | 262144 (0x40000) | 1 uint32. this is not confirmed but i have a feeling about it :D |
| `VISUAL_CHAIN` | 524288 (0x80000) | 2 functions called (same ones as for ranged but different) |
| `RUNE_UPDATE` | 2097152 (0x200000) | 2 bytes for the rune cur and rune next flags |
| `UNK400000` | 4194304 (0x400000) | seems to make server send an uint32 after `m_targets.write` |
