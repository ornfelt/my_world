# SMSG_SPLINE_SET_RUN_SPEED

## Client Version 1.12, Client Version 2, Client Version 3

Informs the client that the run speed of a unit has changed.

Mangos sends this to third parties that aren't having their speed changed and [SMSG_FORCE_RUN_SPEED_CHANGE](./smsg_force_run_speed_change.md) to the client that has their run speed changed.

### Header

SMSG have a header of 4 bytes.

#### SMSG Header

| Offset | Size / Endianness | Type   | Name   | Description |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| 0x00   | 2 **OR** 3 / Big           | uint16 **OR** uint16+uint8 | size | Size of the rest of the message including the opcode field but not including the size field. Wrath server messages **can** be 3 bytes. If the first (most significant) size byte has `0x80` set, the header will be 3 bytes, otherwise it is 2.|
| -      | 2 / Little| uint16 | opcode | Opcode that determines which fields the message contains. |

### Body

| Offset | Size / Endianness | Type | Name | Comment |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| - | - / - | [PackedGuid](../types/packed-guid.md) | guid |  |
| - | 4 / Little | f32 | speed |  |

### Examples

#### Example 1

##### Comment

Object with guid 6 having run speed changed to 7.

```c
0, 8, // size
254, 2, // opcode (766)
1, 6, // guid: PackedGuid
0, 0, 224, 64, // speed: f32
```
