# SMSG_QUERY_TIME_RESPONSE

## Client Version 1.12

Reply to [CMSG_QUERY_TIME](./cmsg_query_time.md).

[CMSG_QUERY_TIME](./cmsg_query_time.md) and this reply does not actually appear to set the time. Instead [SMSG_LOGIN_SETTIMESPEED](./smsg_login_settimespeed.md) seems to correctly set the time. Running the client with `-console` will print the date when [SMSG_LOGIN_SETTIMESPEED](./smsg_login_settimespeed.md) is received, but not when this message is received.
