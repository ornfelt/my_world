# Contributing

Would you like to contribute? Excellent!
Contributing is not just for fixing, but also for reporting bugs or new features.

Creating Pull Requests:
=======================

- Fork it.
- Create a branch (`git checkout -b fixes`)
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Fix bug while Reading CSV Files"`)
- Push to the branch (`git push origin fixes`)
- Open a Pull Request

Required before sending a pull request:
=======================================

- Make sure the repository is up to date.
- From what commit hash
- What have you done to verify that what you are proposing works and/or that the original code doesn't work or that you don't like it and why.
- The changes you want to be made.
- That's all, just wait to verify your change proposal, and if everything goes well, your changes will be published in the official repository through a merge pull request.
